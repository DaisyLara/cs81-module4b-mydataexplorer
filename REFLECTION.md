My predictions were right because I input them all. They would have been more unexpected and interesting if I had seen the assignment at the very beginning of the week and accurately measured my numbers. I grabbed my actual screenTime from my phone settings (yikes), so that was probably the most accurate measure. I have terrible insomnia and ADHD, so I don't think I made an accurate report on screenTime, focus, or mood.
My screen time definitely surprised me. I didn't realize it was possible to spend 17 hours on my phone in one day. I always have some kind of YouTube video playing in the background while I do anything, amd YouTube was my biggest screentime contributor so I should probably learn to be bored again.
I do not like that javaScript gives barely-any feedback in the console. I get error messages that mean nothing to me, and I have to deep dive before eventually giving up and asking an AI engine where I went wrong. One time I got an error saying I misplaced a "}" and I couldn't find what was wrong, but then I found out through Gemini that it was actually a misplaced "." that I had put at the end of my code from muscle memory. How does that make sense?? Whyyy did it make me look at something completely different?
Again, using my own data would have been interesting if it were real numbers because I could really get a full picture of my behavior and be genuinely interested in the correlations, but the data I used was mostly fictional and less rewarding.
